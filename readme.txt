Need to change:

MainActivity.java:
1.base64EncodedPublicKey  (After creating an application in googleplay go to Services & APIs)
2.ITEM_SKU (After creating an application in googleplay go to  In-app Products and add new product with this product id)

NOTE: First publish the app at Alpha Testing and assign a group for testing.
      For testing the app add list of gmail id in testing access (Google Play Setting icon)
